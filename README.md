Currently a quick hack to make it easier to access my configs.

For `.vimrc` to work, you'll need to install `vim-plug` as described in its [repo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). The command for Linux is reproduced below for convenience:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Then, open `vim` and run `:PlugInstall` to download the plugins. No further action must be taken.
